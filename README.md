# GGSCluster - Dockerized OpenSearch, Nginx, Pi-hole and Logstash

GGSCluster is a Docker Compose-based project to deploy a secure, self-hosted OpenSearch cluster with OpenSearch Dashboards, Nginx as a reverse proxy, and Pi-hole as a DNS resolver. This project enables secure HTTPS access to OpenSearch services and custom DNS resolution within a LAN environment.

Logstash is an optional tool for ingesting data to the cluster. It is already configured.

It can be customized to use another domain. Just adjust the nginx reverse proxy configuration, the CNs in the Cluster/Certificates and in your Router/Switch and Pihole DNS configuration.

## Features

- **OpenSearch Cluster**: A two-node OpenSearch cluster for indexing and searching data.
- **OpenSearch Dashboards**: A web-based GUI to interact with and visualize OpenSearch data.
- **Nginx**: A reverse proxy server securing OpenSearch and Dashboards with HTTPS.
- **Pi-hole**: A DNS resolver for custom local domain resolution within the LAN.
- **Logstash**: An optional data ingest tool that can be used for adding data to the cluster

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your system.
- **OpenSSL** for generating certificates.
- **Linux environment** (instructions may vary for other OS).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ggscluster.git
cd ggscluster
```

Generate SSL certificates for OpenSearch, Nginx, and OpenSearch Dashboards:

```bash
./certificates/generate_certificates.sh
```



This script generates a root CA, server certificates, and keys for each service. Customize the SERVICES variable within the script to add or modify service names and SANs.

Trust the Root CA:

Add the generated root CA certificate (root-ca.pem) to your system's trusted certificates.
For Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo cp /path/to/root-ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
sudo update-ca-certificates
```


## Configuration

### docker-compose.yml

Docker Compose File:

    Customize docker-compose.yml to specify service configurations, volume mappings, and ports.

    OpenSearch and Dashboards use port 9200 and 5601 respectively.

Nginx Configuration:

    Update nginx.conf to set up the reverse proxy for OpenSearch (https://ggscluster.com:9200) and Dashboards (https://ggscluster.com:5601).

    Ensure the SSL paths match the generated certificates:

    nginx

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/nginx.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/nginx-key.pem;
    ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/root-ca.pem;

Pi-hole:

    Configure Pi-hole to resolve ggscluster.com to your LAN IP (e.g., 192.168.2.234) by adding a custom DNS entry in Pi-holeâ€™s GUI or setting a static DNS entry in docker-compose.yml.

### docker-compose-logstash-yml

Logstash:

    Configure logstash to fetch and filter data via the logstash folder. You can create your data ingest pipelines. Please remember that the credentials can be created via the security tool from opensearch.

## Usage

Start the Cluster:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```
Start the Data Ingest Tool

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-logstash.yml up -d
```

Access OpenSearch Dashboards:

    Go to https://ggscluster.com:5601/app/home#/.

Pi-hole Admin Interface:

    Access the Pi-hole GUI at https://ggscluster.com/pihole/admin.

OpenSearch API:

    Interact with the OpenSearch API at https://ggscluster.com:9200.

## Security

This setup uses self-signed certificates. To avoid browser security warnings, add the generated root CA to your local trusted certificates. Additionally:

Nginx is configured to use TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 protocols with strong cipher suites.

OpenSearch Dashboards and API access are protected by HTTPS.

## Troubleshooting

Bad Gateway in Nginx: Ensure the proxy_pass URL in nginx.conf correctly references the Docker service names (opensearch-node1 and opensearch-dashboards).

Certificate Not Trusted: Verify the root CA is added to your system's trusted certificates and restart your browser.

Custom DNS Not Resolving: Verify Pi-hole is set as the DNS resolver on your router or client devices.

If you get 

`WARN[0000] Found orphan containers ([opensearch-node2 opensearch-dashboards opensearch-node1 pihole opensearch-nginx]) for this project. If you removed or renamed this service in your compose file, you can run this command with the --remove-orphans flag to clean it up.`

when using both docker-compose.yml. Ignore it, as both docker-compose files use the same network.
